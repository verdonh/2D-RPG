addons- random use things

button- for all the buttons and drop down menus in the editor

colour- its prety ovious. You should use them more often 

grid- the main grid component thats used to draw on

input- you don't use this in this project

pygame_textinput- a thing i downloaded, hope it does what it says.





I'm trying to make a class that can be used for all mouse grid things to select things with a mouse. it would work 
like the grid class curntly does but it could be changed. in the future I expect you to update the current grid class
with this. (and make names here less confusing by renaming the current grid class)
